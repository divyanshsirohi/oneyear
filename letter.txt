			To the love of my life, Barkha,<br><br>
			When I first met you, I wasn't looking for anything. I was content staying in my little world. Quiet, predictable, safe. I convinced myself I was fine with being alone. I had built walls around my heart so high that even I started to believe nothing could get through them.<br><br>

			The gentle soul I was never worthy of holding.<br><br>

			Everything that is pure in me was born the moment I met you. A love that became everything. I’ll hold onto it until my last breath. Because my heart refused to learn the language of goodbye.<br><br>

			From the first glance, I had no choice. All my doubts, worries and fears dissolved. My soul had already chosen you as its forever home, long before my mind understood what forever meant.<br><br>

			From the moment you entered my life everything became softer, warmer, and so much more meaningful. Now every day that I wake up, I have a goal to become a better man for you.<br><br>

			Even during our fights, I always know that no matter what, we will choose each other again. I just know and always have that feeling that I'm meant to be with you. I'm ready to fight anything and everything just to be with you.<br><br>

			Today marks our one year of dating it’s crazy how we ended up together even after everything that has happened. It honestly doesn’t even feel like a year has passed. Time with you just flies.<br><br>

			When I say “I love you,” I mean that I see everything beautiful in you, your kindness, your dreams, and even your unique quirks. I love how thoughtful you are, how you push yourself despite your struggles, and how you constantly strive to be your best. You remind me of the strength and resilience it takes to face challenges head-on, and I’m so proud of you for everything you accomplish, even if you can’t always see it yourself.

			Your presence in my life has been a gift beyond words. You’ve taught me so much about love, trust, and vulnerability. With you, I’m learning what it means to truly give myself to someone, not out of need, but out of a genuine desire to make you feel valued, loved, and enough because you are. I feel lucky to be the one who gets to remind you of that every day.

			I understand that life can sometimes get overwhelming, and I know you may feel uncertain or doubt yourself. But through it all, I’m here, wholeheartedly, to stand by you. I want to be someone you can lean on, someone who loves you exactly as you are, even when things feel difficult. I want to be a safe place where you never have to question if you’re enough, because, to me, you always are.

			I promise to keep doing my best to make you feel special, appreciated, and loved, as you deserve. You mean the world to me, and there’s no way I could ever put into words just how deeply I care for you. I hope that in every smile, every laugh, and every quiet moment together, you feel my love and know just how much you mean to me.

			Thank you for being my everything :)

			Thank you for choosing me, for staying, for caring, and for letting me love you the way I do.<br><br>

			Thank you, Barkha, for once again being a wonderful, sweet human being to me.<br><br>

			Yours, always. 💗
